Goal: Write a single Python script to finetune Llama 3.1 8B on 2x or more GPUs with FSDP2.\n\n2. You must showcase this working in a free **Kaggle notebook with 2 x Tesla T4 GPUs**.\n\n3. Pipeline parallelism is also fine, but must utilize [`zero bubble scheduling`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.pipelining.html#torch.distributed.pipelining.schedules.ScheduleInterleavedZeroBubble) somehow.\n\n4. Can use a pre-quantized 4bit BnB safetensor file from [Unsloth's HF page](https://huggingface.co/unsloth) or a full 16bit one, but must do QLoRA.\n\n5. Can use `accelerate` but must be FSDP2 or related - you can investigate https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/pull/3394, Torch Titan, other repos etc.\n\n6. Must be fully `transformers` compatible - so we must use `TrainingArguments` and `Trainer`, or `TRL` related classes.\n\n7. The loss must be equivalent to single GPU training.\n\n8. You must enable all features in FSDP2 - ie showcase offloading, checkpointing, mixed precision training etc.\n\n9. You can use `nf4` from `torch AO`, but best from `bitsandbytes`.\n\n10. Finally showcase everything working in a free Kaggle 2x Tesla T4 notebook.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Evaluation
